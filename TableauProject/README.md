This is my first Tableau project. 
While working on it, I used Python (Pandas) for data exploration and cleaning to ensure the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis. 
I then utilized SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to query specific data based on the business requirements, extracting only the necessary information for the project. 
After that, I moved to Tableau, where I created the data model and established relationships between the tables to ensure a seamless flow of data. 
Finally, I used Tableau to design and build the visualizations, transforming the raw data into meaningful and actionable insights.
